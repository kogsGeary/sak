  {
     When a message is supplied to espeak_synth, the request is buffered and espeak_synth returns. When the message is really processed, the callback function will be repetedly called.
  

     In RETRIEVAL mode, the callback function supplies to the calling program the audio data and an event list terminated by 0 (LIST_TERMINATED).

     In PLAYBACK mode, the callback function is called as soon as an event happens.
  
     For example suppose that the following message is supplied to espeak_Synth:
     "hello, hello."
  

     * Once processed in RETRIEVAL mode, it could lead to 3 calls of the callback function :

     ** Block 1:
     <audio data> +
     List of events: SENTENCE + WORD + LIST_TERMINATED

     ** Block 2:
     <audio data> +
     List of events: WORD + END + LIST_TERMINATED

     ** Block 3:
     no audio data
     List of events: MSG_TERMINATED + LIST_TERMINATED
  

     * Once processed in PLAYBACK mode, it could lead to 5 calls of the callback function:

     ** SENTENCE
     ** WORD (call when the sounds are actually played)
     ** WORD
     ** END (call when the end of sentence is actually played.)
     ** MSG_TERMINATED

  
     The MSG_TERMINATED event is the last event. It can inform the calling program to clear the user data related to the message.
     So if the synthesis must be stopped, the callback function is called for each pending message with the MSG_TERMINATED event.

     A MARK event indicates a <mark> element in the text.
     A PLAY event indicates an <audio> element in the text, for which the calling program should play the named sound file.

        sometimes be zero (which does NOT indicate end of synthesis).

     type:  type of callback event.  Currently only 1= <audio> element

        parameter.

     size: Equal to (or greatrer than) the size of the text data, in bytes.  This is used in order
        to allocate internal storage space for the text.  This value is not used for

     position:  The position in the text where speaking starts. Zero indicates speak from the
        start of the text.

     position_type:  Determines whether "position" is a number of characters, words, or sentences.
        Values:
  
     end_position:  If set, this gives a character position at which speaking will stop.  A value
        of zero indicates no end position.

           espeakCHARS_WCHAR    Wide characters (wchar_t)
  
        espeakSSML   Elements within < > are treated as SSML elements, or if not recognised are ignored.

        espeakPHONEMES  Text within [[ ]] is treated as phonemes codes (in espeak's Hirshenbaum encoding).

           this pause is suppressed.

  { Note: The espeak_VOICE structure is used for two purposes:
    1.  To return the details of the available voices.
    2.  As a parameter to  espeak_SetVoiceByProperties() in order to specify selection criteria.

     In (1), the "languages" field consists of a list of (UTF8) language names for which this voice
     may be used, each language name in the list is terminated by a zero byte and is also preceded by
     a single byte which gives a "priority" number.  The list of languages is terminated by an
     additional zero byte.

     A language name consists of a language code, optionally followed by one or more qualifier (dialect)
     names separated by hyphens (eg. "en-uk").  A voice might, for example, have languages "en-uk" and
     "en".  Even without "en" listed, voice would still be selected for the "en" language (because
     "en-uk" is related) but at a lower priority.

     The priority byte indicates how the voice is preferred for the language. A low number indicates a
     more preferred voice, a higher number indicates a less preferred voice.

     In (2), the "languages" field consists simply of a single (UTF8) language name, with no preceding
     priority byte.
